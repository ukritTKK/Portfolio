# Auto Light Intensity Detection and Light Switch
  This project is about designing communication protocols between the light intensity sensor and Arduino Pro Mini and writing coding to make them works together in C#
  Its methods are 
  1. Detecting light intensity around the sensor and communicate with the Arduino.
  2. The Arduino Pro Mini will decide whether or not to turn the light bulb on.
